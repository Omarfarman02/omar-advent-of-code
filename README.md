# 🎄 Advent of Code — Omar

This repository contains my solutions for selected puzzles from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), using **JavaScript** and **Jest** for testing.

Each folder under the root represents one AoC "day" and includes the following:

- ✅ `part1.js` — Solution for Part 1
- ✅ `part2.js` — Solution for Part 2
- 🧪 `dayX.test.js` — Jest test file (based on sample and real data)
- 📄 `input.txt` — Puzzle input (not included in version control)
- 📘 `README.md` — Problem summary, approach, and AI notes

## 📦 Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies** (Jest):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run all tests**:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. **Run a specific day's part manually**:
   ```bash
   node day1/part1.js
   node day1/part2.js
   ```

## 🧠 AI Usage Disclosure

I used **ChatGPT** to help:

- Refactor and optimize code.
- Improve test coverage and readability.
- Write rich comments and documentation like this.

All code was reviewed and customized by me to ensure correctness and understanding.
